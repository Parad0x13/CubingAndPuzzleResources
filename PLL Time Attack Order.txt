Mine goes back to the solved state  AND it's nice to perform (for me).
I was customizing my PLL order to get a smooth transition from every PLL to the next,
and I got a solved cube at the end by chance, so that order's been stuck ever since.

G: R U R' y' R2 Uw' R U' R' U R' Uw R2 (smooth transition into next G)
G: R'2 Uw' R U' R U R' Uw R2 y R U' R' (smooth transition into next G)
G: R' U' R y R'2 Uw R' U R U' R Uw' R2 (smooth transition into next G)
G: R'2 Uw R' U R' U' R Uw' R2 y' R' U R (smooth transition into N)
N: R' U R U' R' F' U' F R U R' F R' F' R U' R (smooth transition into next N)
N: R U' R' U Lw U F U' R' F' R U' R U Lw' U Lw' (smooth transition into E)
E: U R' U' L U R U' Rw'2 U' R U L U' R' U (smooth transition into A)
A: R U' R D2 R' U R D2 R'2 (smooth transition into next A)
A: R2 D'2 R' U' R D'2 R' U R'
H: M'2 U M'2 U2 M'2 U M'2 (smooth transition into Z)
Z: U2 M'2 U M'2 U M' U2 M'2 U2 M'
R: U R U'2 R' U2 Lw U' R' F' R F R U (R' Lw') (smooth transition into F)
F: U' R' U R U' (R' Lw') Dw' R' U R y' R U R' U' (R Lw) (smooth transition into R)
R: R' U2 R U'2 R' F R U R' U' R' F' R2 U' (smooth transition into V)
V: R' U R' U' y R' F' R2 U' R' U R' F R F (smooth transition into U)
U: R U' R U R U R U' R' U' R2 (smooth transition into next U)
U: R'2 U R U R' U' R' U' R' U R' (smooth transition into Y)
Y: F R U' R' U' R U R' F' R U R' U' R' F' R F' (smooth transition into T)
T: R U R' U' R' F R2 U' R' U' R U R' F' (smooth transition into J)
J: R U2 R' U' R U2 L' U R' U' Rw (smooth transition into next J) (the RFU J perm flows nicely from T, but not to the next J)
J: (you already did an x rotation) U2 Rw' U' Rw U2 Lw' U R' U' R2
Solved!

If you use non-slicing H and Z perms, then the whole sequence just flows like magic. But, I like slicing 

I can hit 9.xx tps from the nice R perm onwards. It's part of my "philosophy" that PLL time attacks should
start with the bad algs and end with the nice ones, this way I can just stop the timer and reset if I don't
sub-8 after the G's, or if I don't sub-13 after the N's, something like that. And smooth algs at the end are
always better because that's when you tend to get nervous and lock up.

It's not the best, but it can't be a bad sequence either, because I can sub-40 with it

I also did a bit of my own study/research and found this order to be good: Gs E Ns Rs V F Js As Us H Z Y T
