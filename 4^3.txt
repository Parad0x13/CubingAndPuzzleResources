last two that supposed are supposed to line up, make them side by side, not diagonal

algorithm:

L' F U' L F

Now that they are diagonal... fix that make them side by side

algorithm:

d R F' U R' F d'

and now corners swap for the last layer

algorithm:

r2 U2 r2 U2 u2 r2 u2

and for two edges

r2 U2 r2 U2 u2 r2 u2

and for one that needs to be swapped upside down

r2 B2 U2 l U2 r' U2 r U2 F2 r F2 l' B2 r2

that last algorithm works perfectly on a 5^3 too
